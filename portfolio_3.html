        <h2>Number Sysytems?</h2>
        <p>Number systems are fundamental frameworks in mathematics and computer science that provide a structured way to represent and manipulate numbers. They serve as the backbone for various applications, from basic arithmetic to complex computing processes. At their core, number systems define how numbers are expressed using a specific set of symbols and rules, allowing for consistent communication and calculation.</p>
        <p>Understanding different number systems is essential for grasping how data is processed in computers, as each system has distinct characteristics that affect how information is stored and manipulated. For instance, while humans typically use the decimal system for everyday calculations, computers rely on binary due to its simplicity and efficiency in electronic circuitry.</p>

          <p> The use of number systems is essential for representing numbers with a small set of symbols, which is particularly advantageous in computing. Computers primarily utilize binary numbers—0 and 1—to simplify calculations and minimize the amount of necessary circuitry. This efficiency leads to reduced space requirements, lower energy consumption, and decreased costs. Moreover, number systems enable us to communicate effectively with computers, facilitating various tasks we perform daily. For instance, when we use the internet, binary plays a crucial role in IP addressing. Additionally, number systems are vital for encrypting data, helping to prevent hacking and misuse of sensitive information. It is important to recognize that every piece of data stored in a computer is ultimately represented as a number. Without number systems, our society would regress to a primitive state akin to the "Stone Age," underscoring their fundamental importance in modern life.</p>

              <p>One of the most critical applications of number systems lies in computing (the different computing disciplines/majors). Computers, as digital machines, need a way to represent and process data or in other words their very own simple language. Given their reliance on electronic circuits that recognize only two states (on and off), the binary system becomes the most ideal method for representing information. In binary, numbers are represented using only two digits, 0’s and 1’s, making it perfectly suited for digital devices. The significance of the binary system is immense, as it supports the foundation of almost all modern computing, from basic arithmetic operations to complex algorithms and data storage of computers.

              <p>The Types of Number Systems</p>
              <p>The Decimal Number System, or base 10 system, is the one we use most frequently in everyday life (can also be called the counting numbers). It uses ten different digits namely 0 to 9. For example, in the number 345, the 5 is in the ones place, the 4 in the tens place, and the 3 in the hundreds place (don’t forget the base 10 sign to not confuse it with octal number systems).</p>
              <p>The simplicity and familiarity of the decimal system makes it the default system for our daily calculations. It is intuitive because we typically count in tens, perhaps due to the number of fingers on our hands. While the decimal system is well-suited for human interaction, it is not ideal for computing since computers operate only operate in twos(binary).</p>
              <p>The Binary Number System uses only two digits: 0’s and 1’s. This system is fundamental to computers due to its direct correspondence to the on-off states of electronic circuits. Each binary digit (bit) represents an on (1) or off (0) state. In the binary system, numbers are expressed as sums of powers of 2. For instance, the binary number 1011 is equivalent to 11 in decimal (1\*2³ + 0\*2² + 1\*2¹ + 1\*2⁰).              </p>
              <p>The “Octal Number System is not that commonly used” (“Octal Explained: The Programmer’s Base-8 Code | Lenovo US”) but is still significant in computing. It uses eight digits (0-7), and each position in an octal number represents a power of 8. </p>
              <p>The Hexadecimal Number System uses sixteen symbols: the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F, where A represents 10, B represents 11, and so on up to F, which represents 15. Each position in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16.</p>
              <p>In my opinion Hexadecimal is highly favored because it can compactly represent large binary numbers. Because four binary digits correspond to a single hexadecimal digit, making it easier for programmers to read and write machine code. For example, the binary number 11110000 is represented as F0 in hexadecimal.</p>
